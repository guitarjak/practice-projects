Hello friends, welcome to my coding journey!

I am a normal guy with normal 8am - 5pm job in Phuket, Thailand. Learning how to code myself with no prior knowledge. I have a dream that one day I can be a solopreneur/digital nomad that I can be able to support my family and doesn't have to worry about financial problem anymore!

Take a peak of my projects here!
